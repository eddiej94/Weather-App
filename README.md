# Weather-App

Weather app created with HTML, CSS, BOOSTSTRAP, and Vanila Javascript.

I used the https://openweathermap.org/api to fetch data for each states weather information. 

I reviewed the API documentation  to have the correct information show up with state ZIP code.

App is only avaible for US weather i specified it to show only within the US.
